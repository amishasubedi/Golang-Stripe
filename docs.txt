1. `main.go`: Entry point to your application. It starts the server and sets up routes.

2. `handlers.go`: Defines functions (handlers) that process specific HTTP requests for certain routes.

3. `routes.go`: Associates routes (URL paths) with corresponding handlers.

4. `render.go`: Manages rendering of HTML templates with data.

5. `go.mod` and `go.sum`: Manage dependencies and ensure their integrity.

Here's a brief rundown of the process:

When you run your app, `main.go` starts a server and sets up routes. When a client sends a request, the server finds the route in `routes.go`, runs the associated handler from `handlers.go`, which may render an HTML template via `render.go`, and sends the response back to the client.

The `cmd` and `internal` folders follow Go's project structure recommendations. The `cmd` contains the app's entry points, and `internal` contains code only for the current module. The `api` and `web` folders may contain definitions for APIs and code handling web requests and responses, respectively.
